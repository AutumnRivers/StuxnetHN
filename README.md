## New Executables
### `RadioV3` / `#RADIO_V3#`
![RadioV3 Example](./docs/images/radiov3_example.png)

Gone are the days of listening to the same song on repeat during a long mission, gone are the days of `SongChangerDaemon`, and gone are the days of `Tuneswap`!

**RadioV3** is the next evolution in extension music - players unlock new songs by going through the extension, or by entering codes. You can also deny radio access to the player at any time - in the case of things like cutscenes.

Get your golden funky groove on and grab yourself a copy of **RadioV3**!

## W.T.F. (What The FTPSprint) is Stuxnet?
Depends on the context. This Stuxnet, the one you're looking at, is a Pathfinder mod for Hacknet that adds all sorts of goodies for extension developers to use.

Outside of this context, [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) is widely considered to be the first "cyber weapon," affecting machines in real life, rather than only doing digital damage.

## Who can use it?
**Anyone!** (as long as they have Hacknet: Labyrinths installed...)

Yeah, the mod uses some assets from Labyrinths. Certain things would break if Labyrinths were not installed.

All I ask in return, if you do use this in your extensions, *please* be sure to credit me!

## Well, what does it add?
Read on to find out. Impatient!

## New Executables
### `RadioV3` / `#RADIO_V3#`
![RadioV3 Example](./docs/images/radiov3_example.png)

Gone are the days of listening to the same song on repeat during a long mission, gone are the days of `SongChangerDaemon`, and gone are the days of `Tuneswap`!

**RadioV3** is the next evolution in extension music - players unlock new songs by going through the extension, or by entering codes. You can also deny radio access to the player at any time - in the case of things like cutscenes.

Get your golden funky groove on and grab yourself a copy of **RadioV3**!

Stuxnet 2.0 "WannaCry" Breaking Changes List
--------------------------------------------

† = If you do not follow this change, your extension WILL break!

-- MULTIPLE
* Codes, songs, any sort of configuration has been moved to a central stuxnet_config.json file.†
    * This file is placed at the root of the extension's directory.
    * There should be a template file included with 2.0's release.
* Paths in Stuxnet no longer start with a forward slash (`/`). Update this in your configs.

-- CUTSCENES
The entire cutscene system has been completely rewritten, and as such, things are borked.

* Stuxnet cutscenes are no longer called by ID, and are instead, called by filepath.
* If you'd like to pre-cache a cutscene anyway, use <PreloadCutscene>
    * <RegisterStuxnetCutscene> has been renamed to this, and will be removed in Stuxnet 2.1†
* TriggerCutscene now has a FilePath attribute instead of a CutsceneID attribute.†
* Cutscene layouts have been completely changed. Read the updated documentation for more information.†
* The logcutscenedata command no longer exists.

-- ACTIONS
* <PlaceNodeOnNetMap> no longer has a StartingPosition attribute. Remove it from your actions.†
    * The anchor is the top left of the netmap, or 0,0.

-- THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN DEVELOPERS
* The SongEntry class has been moved from the `Stuxnet_HN.Executables` namespace to just `Stuxnet_HN`.
    * This also applies to CodeEntry and SequencerInfo.
    * This breaks ZeroDayToolkit 1.0's Stuxnet compatibility.† This will likely be fixed in 0DTK 1.0.4

-- RULES --
* Entries starting with "//" are comments, and should be ignored or outright deleted
* Do not translate "{0}" (or similar), these are used in string formatting
* I DO NOT recommend translating proper nouns/names of programs (e.g., "Messenger" and "Wireshark" should not be translated)
* If you are not going to translate a line, then please delete the line from your language's JSON file
* If you ever want more context on a line, please do not hesitate to ask me
